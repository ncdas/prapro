We have a dataset for a week including day, temperature in celsius and rain posibility in percentage We have to find out the bellow things:

    1. Hotest day of the week
    2. Coolest day of the week
    3. How many days will have more than 50% rain posibility.


----------Understanding the problem-------------
I Have: 
    - Week including day names(String).
    - Everyday temperature in celsius(Number).
    - Everyday rain possibility(Number up to 100).

Have to do:
    - Show the name of the Hottest day of the week.(#1) 
        * Compare everyday temperature values and find the 
        biggest number among all and then show the name of the value 
        as output as hottest day of the week. 
    - Show the name of the Hottest day of the week.(#2)
        * Compare everyday temperature values and find the 
        smallest number among all and then show the name of the value 
        as output as coolest day of the week. 
    - Show the number of days has more than 50% rain possibility.(#3)
        * Scan all weeks rain data and find which days has the number 
        more than 50(start at 51), count them in and show the sum 
        of total findings.
