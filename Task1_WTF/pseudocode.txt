We have a dataset for a week including day, temperature in celsius and rain posibility in percentage We have to find out the bellow things:

    1. Hotest day of the week
    2. Coolest day of the week
    3. How many days will have more than 50% rain posibility.


----------Understanding the problem-------------
I Have: 
    - Week including day names(String).
    - Everyday temperature in celsius(Number).
    - Everyday rain possibility(Number up to 100).

Have to do:
    - Show the name of the Hottest day of the week.(#1) 
        * Compare everyday temperature values and find the 
        biggest number among all and then show the name of the value 
        as output as hottest day of the week. 
    - Show the name of the Hottest day of the week.(#2)
        * Compare everyday temperature values and find the 
        smallest number among all and then show the name of the value 
        as output as coolest day of the week. 
    - Show the number of days has more than 50% rain possibility.(#3)
        * Scan all weeks rain data and find which days has the number 
        more than 50(start at 51), count them in and show the sum 
        of total findings.

Pseudocode: Total Rainy Day
-----------------------------
    // vaiable Declare and initialization
        all_rainy_days = 0, total_dayOf_Rain = 0;

    // Loop through object
        for (key in object)
            //statement
                if (rain > 50)
                    all_rainy_days += 1
                else
                    print "not much rain comming"
                end if
        end Loop
    
Pseudocode: Coolest days of the week. 
--------------------------------------
    // Varibale declaretion
        coolest_temp = 100
        coolest_days = []

    // Loop through the object
        for (key in object)
            if (temp < coolest_temp)
                coolest_temp = temp
                reset arrary
                push temp(x) in the array
            
            else if (temp == coolest_temp)
                coolest_temp = temp
                add/push x in the array
            else 
                do nothing
            end if 
        end loop
